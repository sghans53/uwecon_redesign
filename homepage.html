        <h2>What is ECON?</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Economics studies the institutions and arrangements that are used to create, protect, and allocate scarce resources that have alternative uses. It advances our understanding of the behavior of individuals, firms, governments and other organizations. Economics’ deep intellectual roots, rigorous analytic methods, and powerful ability to explain and evaluate social phenomena make it an exceptionally rewarding field of study.</p>
            <p>Established in 1917, Economics is one of the largest and oldest departments in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, offering the BA, BS, MA, and PhD. Our faculty strengths include econometrics, finance, macroeconomics, international economics, industrial organization, environmental economics, development economics, and microeconomic theory.</p>
