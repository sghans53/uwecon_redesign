                <h2>Undergraduate Program -- Bachelor of Arts</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Economics provides an excellent preparation for employment in the private and public sectors, and for graduate study in a variety of fields, such as law and MBA programs.

                    The importance of economics among the social sciences, and its appeal to many students who choose it as a major, reflects its deep intellectual roots, its rigorous analytical methods, and its powerful ability to explain social phenomena. An economics major trains students not only in deductive methods of logic, but also in inductive methods of reasoning using statistical methods and a variety of social and economic data. A firm foundation in economics is essential to a meaningful training in business administration, public administration, or social science.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Admission Requirements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ECON 200 Introduction to Microeconomics</li>
                        <li>ECON 201 Introduction to Macroeconomics</li>
                        <li>STAT 311 Elements of Statistical Methods</li>
                        <li>MATH 124 Calculus with Analytic Geometry I</li>
                        <li>One English Composition course</li>
                        <li>Completion of the RTW assessment </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Career Pathways</h3>
                    <p>Most students will graduate and enter some sort of employment, finding that a career takes shape after a succession of employment positions. Most students do not have plans for advanced study after graduation in economics or other fields. Some students consider that they might go on to graduate or professional school such as law, information science, business administration, public affairs, education, or international studies. The B.A. in economics provides the flexibility to allow all these students to pursue a demanding major in a social science, be prepared for employment in a variety of areas, and to take related and complementary courses outside the department.</p>

                <h2>Undergraduate Program -- Bachelor of Science</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The Bachelor of Science with a Major in Economics emphasizes the study of mathematics and quantitative techniques along with economic theory, application methods, and social studies. The course of study requires a more intensive background in math and statistics, reflecting the quantitative character of modern economics. This program provides preparation for employment in technical and scientific areas and is appropriate for graduate studies in economics and related fields such as statistics, mathematics and finance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Admission Requirements</h3>

                        <li>ECON 201 Introduction to Macroeconomics</li>
                        <li>STAT 311 Elements of Statistical Methods</li>
                        <li>MATH 124, MATH 125, and MATH 126 Calculus with Analytic Geometry </li>
                        <li>One English Composition course</li>
                        <li>Completion of the RTW assessment </li>

                    <h3>Career Pathways</h3>
                    <p>If your goal is to earn a Ph. D. in economics, then completing the requirements of the B.S. would be the appropriate choice for you. Both the admission and the graduation requirements for the B.S. in economics prepare one for and give an indication of the nature of graduate study in economics. To be admitted to the BS one must have a year of calculus, and a year of calculus is the minimum mathematics required by graduate programs in economics. The more rigorous and quantitative courses required to graduate with a B.S. give one a taste, at the undergraduate level, of the emphasis on economic theory and statistics characteristic of graduate study in economics.</p>
